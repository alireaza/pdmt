-m	PDMT selects maximum possible 
        number of connections automatically.but you can choose maximum number
        yourself(1-16).default is 16.

-r	(y for yes,n for no) default is no.Reconnecting ability.if aria2
        decreases the number of connections (connections failed),PDMT will 
        pause and resume download.I suggest that use this option if your
        download size is bigger than 100 MB.

        you can write aria2 options after o

        (options are shutdown , hibernate , suspend )

        enter root password.if you don't enter password after -w or if you enter
        wrong password,PDMT will ask you for root password before start downloading.

-f      Download queue.if you have many links and you want to download them in
        queue(one by one),you can use this option.links must enterd in a file
        in seperate lines.every line for one link with no space between lines.
        after that you must enter the file's address that you save links in it.
